# National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts 2025 Edition

The National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts (NFBAs) measure the ecological resource use and resource regeneration capacity of countries over time. Based on approximately 15,000 data points per country per year, mostly from UN data sets, the Accounts contain the Ecological Footprint and biocapacity of over 200 countries, territories, and regions from 1961 to 2022, providing the core data needed for all Ecological Footprint analysis worldwide. Preliminary estimates are provided up to the year 2024. This Data Package contains Ecological Footprint and biocapacity as well as Human Development and population data to give a first approximation of the biological resource situation of these countries. Under the mandate and governance of the Footprint Data Foundation (FoDaDo), a collaboration of Global Footprint Network and York University, the National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts 2025 Edition are produced by the Ecological Footprint Initiative of York University.
